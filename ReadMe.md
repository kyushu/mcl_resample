# This project is about Monte Carlo Location(Particle filter) and a part of Udacity Robotics software nano degree course

For visualizing particle's motion, i use GnuPlot to plot particles for each iteration

# Prerequisite
my environment is Ubuntu and you need to install gnuplot
```bash
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
```

# Particle visualization
create and go to  `build` folder
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

than run `resampling_evaluate` for ploting particle's motion
